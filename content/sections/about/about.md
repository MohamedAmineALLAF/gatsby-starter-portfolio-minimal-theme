As a software and data engineering student, I have a passion for coding and exploration with continous expanding of my knowledge and skills in this field !

Throughout my academic career, I have gained experience in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, as well as data analysis tools like SQL and R. I have worked on various projects, ranging from developing applications to extracting insights from large datasets, which have given me the opportunity to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.

As a team player, I am always eager to learn from others and contribute to a shared goal. I believe that effective communication is crucial for success in any project, and my strong communication skills enable me to effectively articulate complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
